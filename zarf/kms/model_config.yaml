# ==============================================================================
# MODEL SELECTION NOTES
#
# These suffixes define how a Large Language Model (LLM) is quantized—compressed
# from its original size to fit into computer memory (RAM/VRAM). The primary
# difference lies in the balance between model size, inference speed, and output
# accuracy (intelligence).
#
# - F16 (FP16): Unquantized, maximum quality, largest size.
# - Q8_0: 8-bit, near-lossless compression, very high quality. (Best for local)
# - K_XL: K-quant (smart) method, high efficiency, better accuracy than
#         standard _0 at similar sizes.
#
# Also, the FP8/F16 or even FP4 are more for modern nvidia cards,are all the
# precision of the floating point numbers. All operations are accelerated by
# the GPU.
#
# Most of the modern GPUs have the hardware for FP16, and other formats, like FP8
# (Q8) or FP4 are emulated.
#
# If you have hardware support for FP8, it will be roughly double the speed of FP16.
#
# There are also INT4/INT8 models, but that's already weird. They take the
# floating point numbers and convert them to the int in the given precision.
#
# For us, on Apple M4 chips, there's still some performance to be gained.
# See: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/336
# However, llama.cpp doesn't currently support the MLX framework.

# ==============================================================================
# ROPE AND YARN NOTES
#
# YaRN (Yet another RoPE extensioN) enables extended context windows beyond a
# model's native training length. For example, Qwen3 models trained on 32k can
# support 131k context with YaRN scaling.
#
# Minimal configuration for YaRN (llama.cpp auto-calculates the rest):
#   rope-scaling-type: yarn
#   yarn-orig-ctx: 32768       # Original training context size
#   context-window: 131072     # Desired extended context
#
# Auto-calculated defaults when using YaRN:
#   rope-freq-base    - Read from model metadata (Qwen3 = 1000000, Llama = 10000)
#   rope-freq-scale   - Auto-calculated from context ratio
#   yarn-ext-factor   - Auto-calculated (nil triggers this)
#   yarn-attn-factor  - 1.0
#   yarn-beta-fast    - 32.0
#   yarn-beta-slow    - 1.0
#
# The advanced parameters exist for models with non-standard RoPE configurations
# (e.g., DeepSeek-V2). For typical YaRN usage, the minimal config is sufficient.
#
# Note: Extended context increases KV cache memory proportionally. A 4x context
# extension (32k → 131k) requires 4x the KV cache VRAM per slot.

# ==============================================================================
# CONFIGURATION NOTES
#
# SPC and IMC are mutually exclusive - choose one based on your model's
# template consistency.
#
# SYSTEM PROMPT CACHE (SPC)
# -------------------------
# Use SPC for models with inconsistent templates (GPT-OSS, GLM) or for
# simple chat applications. SPC caches only the system prompt.
#
# The client should pass the KRONK_CACHE_ID header with a unique
# session/user ID. If no header is passed, the "default" id is used
# which causes problems on multi-user systems.
#
#   system-prompt-cache: true
#
# INCREMENTAL MESSAGE CACHE (IMC)
# -------------------------------
# Use IMC for models with consistent templates (QWEN, Llama) where the
# template produces identical output for the same messages regardless of
# conversation length. IMC caches all messages except the last one and
# extends incrementally.
#
# The client should pass the KRONK_CACHE_ID header with a unique
# session/user ID. If no header is passed, the "default" id is used
# which causes problems on multi-user systems.
#
#   incremental-cache: true
#
# KV CACHE PARTITIONING
# ---------------------------------------
# llama.cpp internally partitions the KV cache across sequences. Each
# slot gets context-window / nseq-max tokens of capacity. Cache type
# (off, SPC, IMC) does not affect VRAM — all modes allocate the same
# slots and KV cache. The difference is how cached state is managed:
#
#   No caching: Slots cleared after each request.
#   SPC:        System prompt tokens cached in RAM, re-decoded per request.
#   IMC:        Slots dedicated to a user, full conversation cached in KV.
#
# AGENT CLIENT NOTES
# -------------------------------
# Cline is working great with Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-UD-Q8_K_XL/IMC. The
# settings use a KV Cache type of f16. You need to use f16 to get the accuracy
# from the model we need.
#
# NOTE: The R1 message format in Cline is a specialized prompt structure
# required for DeepSeek R1 models, which converts system prompts into user
# messages. Turn that off.
#
# Kilo Code is working get with gpt-oss-120b-F16. When the KV Cache type is f16,
# the model is being accurate with tool calling. Agent clients that use
# traditional tool calling, use this model.
#
# MISCELLANEOUS NOTES
# -------------------------------
# You will notice with the Qwen3-8B-Q8_0 model a YARN configuration. This is
# how you can extend the models context window when you need it.
