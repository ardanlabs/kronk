# MODEL SELECTION NOTES
#
# These suffixes define how a Large Language Model (LLM) is quantized—compressed
# from its original size to fit into computer memory (RAM/VRAM). The primary
# difference lies in the balance between model size, inference speed, and output
# accuracy (intelligence).
#
# - F16 (FP16): Unquantized, maximum quality, largest size.
# - Q8_0: 8-bit, near-lossless compression, very high quality. (Best for local)
# - K_XL: K-quant (smart) method, high efficiency, better accuracy than
#         standard _0 at similar sizes.

# Also, the FP8/F16 or even FP4 are more for modern nvidia cards,are all the
# precision of the floating point numbers. All operations are accelerated by
# the GPU.

# Most of the modern GPUs have the hardware for FP16, and other formats, like FP8
# (Q8) or FP4 are emulated.

# If you have hardware support for FP8, it will be roughly double the speed of FP16.

# There are also INT4/INT8 models, but that's already weird. They take the
# floating point numbers and convert them to the int in the given precision.

# For us, on Apple M4 chips, there's still some performance to be gained.
# See: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/336
# However, llama.cpp doesn't currently support the MLX framework.

# CONFIGURATION NOTES:
#
# If you want to try using a model with an Agent, use these settings:
#   nseq-max: 1
#   first-message-cache: true
#
# If you want to use a Chat application like OpenWebUI use these settings:
#   system-prompt-cache: true
#
# Cline is working great with cerebras_qwen3-coder-reap-25b-a3b-q8_0
#
# Claude Code needs a model that handles tool calling well with a decent
# context window. The GPT models have not performed well. I have not
# found a model yet that does for Claude Code.
