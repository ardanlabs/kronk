run: installation invalid: init: unable to load library: C:\Users\Ramon\.kronk\libraries\ggml.dll: error loading library: Não foi possível encontrar o módulo especificado.

 On Windows, the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable (line 47-49) is a Linux/macOS concept. Windows uses PATH instead for DLL search.
 On Windows, when ggml.dll is loaded, it has dependencies (like ggml-cpu.dll, ggml-base.dll, etc.). Windows looks for these in:

	Same directory as the .exe
	System directories
	Directories in PATH

Solution:Change LD_LIBRARY_PATH to PATH, when on Windows, in sdk/kronk/init.go

#3 ==========================================================
Two problems in sdk/tools/models/retrieve.go:

1> strings.TrimLeft is wrong here—it trims characters, not a prefix. Should use strings.TrimPrefix.

2> Hardcoded / separator—Windows uses \. Should use filepath.Separator or filepath.SplitList.
