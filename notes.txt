Windows related issues:

#1 ===========================================================
$ go install github.com/ardanlabs/kronk/cmd/kronk@latest
# github.com/ardanlabs/kronk/cmd/kronk/server/start
C:\Users\Ramon\go\pkg\mod\github.com\ardanlabs\kronk@v1.13.8\cmd\kronk\server\start\start.go:36:4: unknown field Setsid in struct literal of type "syscall".SysProcAttr

Solution: Created an tagged file per OS to handle the detaching process, as Windows does not support the Setsid field.
The same was done for killing the detached process.

This error arrised another error when entering the detaching loop:
proc := exec.Command(exePath, "server") -> this path just shows a help message, because the subcommand "start" is missing.
proc := exec.Command(exePath, "server", "start") -> fixed version


#2 ==========================================================
$ kronk server start
...
run: installation invalid: init: unable to load library: C:\Users\Ramon\.kronk\libraries\ggml.dll: error loading library: Não foi possível encontrar o módulo especificado.

 On Windows, the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable (sdk/kronk/init.go:47-49) is a Linux/macOS concept. Windows uses PATH instead for DLL search.
 On Windows, when ggml.dll is loaded, it has dependencies (like ggml-cpu.dll, ggml-base.dll, etc.). Windows looks for these in:

	Same directory as the .exe
	System directories
	Directories in PATH

Solution: Changed LD_LIBRARY_PATH to PATH, when on Windows, in sdk/kronk/init.go

#3 ==========================================================
Two problems in sdk/tools/models/retrieve.go causing http 500 errors with some tools of the kronk server:

1> strings.TrimLeft trims characters, not a prefix. Should use strings.TrimPrefix.

2> Hardcoded / separator; Windows uses \. Should use filepath.Separator or filepath.SplitList.
